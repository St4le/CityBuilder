It really assist others in making informed purchases when spending there hard earned money :)

Easy to use:
- Drag & Drop a blueprint into your scene.
- Adjust the parts down to the right height to match flat or uneven terrain.
- Paint some paths to the surroundings.
- Add your own animals, crops, plants and trees to your game scene to finish the lived in look & feel.

The Cottage has a plinth added and raised +- 1m above the ground so that placement on an uneven terrain is quick and easy
If you do not want the plinths, just hide it, or delete and save as a new prefab.
You will see that the internal makeup is very well organized so that you do not have just a HUGE list of parts.
Sections are kept separate so that you can get a handle on them easily.


Enjoy
